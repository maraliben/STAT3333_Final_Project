##                              Technology Useage & Stress Wellness

For our project, we plan on analyzing the “Tech Use & Stress Wellness” dataset from 
Kaggle. We want to see how tech usage can affect stress/wellness 
levels among different groups (including but not limited to different age groups, genders, and 
locations).

```{r}
data <- read.csv("Tech_Use_Stress_Wellness.csv")
View(data)
```
